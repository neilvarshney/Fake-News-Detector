# Fake News Detector

A machine learning-powered web application that helps users identify potentially fake news articles using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Logistic Regression.

## Features

- ü§ñ Machine Learning Model: Uses BERT embeddings and Logistic Regression for accurate fake news detection
- üîê User Authentication: Secure login and registration system with password hashing
- üìä Analysis History: Track and review your past news analyses
- üéØ Confidence Scores: Get probability scores for each prediction
- üì± Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- CSS3 with modern features (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- Custom fonts (Poppins, Playfair Display)

### Backend
- Flask (Python)
- SQLite Database
- JWT Authentication
- BERT (Hugging Face Transformers)
- Scikit-learn

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for faster BERT processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python model.py
```

4. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

2. Update the database configuration in `backend/app.py` if needed.

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## Usage

1. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
2. Paste a news article text into the analysis section
3. Click "Check Authenticity" to get the prediction
4. View your analysis history in the right panel
5. Click on any history item to view full details

## Model Training

The model is trained on the Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset. The training process:
1. Uses BERT to generate embeddings for news articles
2. Trains a Logistic Regression classifier on these embeddings
3. Saves the trained model for future use

## Security Features

- Password hashing using Werkzeug's security functions
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
